# starlingGo

A Go module to extract data from the users starling bank account and create a simple html report of how much usable balance is left.

Primarily a way of teaching myself Go so will initially be horrible to look at.


### TODO
- Add tests
- Add methods for handling starling incoming webhooks
- Add github actions
- Document
